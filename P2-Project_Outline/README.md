For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
This is a mobile app to loudly remind forgetful folks to do something if they start to leave the bounds of a location.
 
Imagine you borrowed a crockpot from your parent.  Everytime you visit them, you forget to grab the crockpot on your way out of the house. If you knew you were visiting them later today you can use this app to *quickly* remind yourself to grab the crockpot. If you leave the house without grabbing it, an alarm with a notification message will sound. 

### Features
####Initial basic features:
 - Leave alert: Users will be able to create an alert for leaving their current location.
 - Alarm: The app will play a loud alarm and display a notificaiton when leaving a location
 - Cancel alarm: Users will be able to cancel the "leave alert" to avoid an alarm going off
 - Custom radius distance: User will be able to adjust how far location to remind them 

####Future app expansion if there is time:
 - Add location via address or map
 - Manage task lists for various locations (or wifi connections)
 - Allow configuring whether an alarm, notification, or both is played
 - Record voice alarms to play 
 - Integrate into Google assistant with key phrase "before I leave..."
